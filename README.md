# Portfolio
My portfolio
In my portfolio project I really wanted to make it simple but very appealing to the eyes.
My goal with making this was to help people understand who i am and help them understand what it is that I do.
Becasue im going to school about social media marketing I leaned very heavily on that with my portfolio. 
With this week going more into Jquery and me already having a portfolio I decided to update my previous portfolia with this week assignment becasue I was already super satisfied with my porfolio
